Hello! Welcome to my resume page.

This is my largest project, and is also my final project for my first Web Development cohort for Code Louisville.

In this project, I am utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing webpage to demonstrade my previous learning of these languages and best practices.

While it may not be perfect, I'm proud of it!

The three features I've including for this project that meet the certificate of completion reuirements are as follows:

A responive navbar with JavaScript utilizing a scroll listener, to assist the webpage visitor in having navigation throughout the entirity of the page.

A responsive menu utilizing CSS, in which the navbar will turn into a "hamburger" icon when media query requirements are met.

I have utilized PageSpeed insights via Google Dev Tools and recieved a score of 69, but will make continous improvements to receive a better score.

(Also to note: Accessibility Insights received a score of 100)

And last but not least (as this is a continous project) I have added transition animations to several elements on hovering.

I hope you enjoyed this project! Within it I have linked several other projects that I am proud of, but could definitely see improvement. I'm learning every day!

Happy Coding!
