            <h2>Hi, I'm Aaron!</h2>

            I am a Junior Web Developer from Louisville, Kentucky! I started my technology career as a
            Telecommunications Engineer, a mere eight years later, I'm branching into the world of development.
            My career has been very good to me, however I lack the creative freedom in my day-to-day life, which is
            why I chose Web Development and design. I started my development career with backend
            development, but shortly realized that front end suited me better. I'm actively seeking work as a Junior
            Dev, and always open to hearing opportunities you may have. I'd be a great asset to your team,
            not only for workload because I'm a powerhouse and learn quickly, but I play enough video games and have
            watched enough of The Witcher to feel confident in defending my team against a sudden
            outbreak of a Zombie Virus.

                <h3>Aussie Adoption Hub</h3>
                <p>If you're anything like me, you are a lover of all animals, and especially dogs. I've trained dogs
                    for a while now and decided that I would like one of my first projects to be an adoption hub for
                    Australian Shepherds, where you can get the information you need about the breed itself, find
                    training resources near you, and find actual rescues near you as well. This site does NOT have
                    actual dogs for adoption! I'm very sorry. </p>

                <p>As a lover of animals (hence my fist full length project), there is only one thing I might love more,
                    and that's coffee. One of my first projects I ever completed via freeCodeCamps knowledge test, this
                    project is a simple coffee shop survey form, similar to what you would see at a local coffee shop
                    that would like to know how their service was!</p>

                <h3>Text Based RPG</h3>
                <p>Well... it isn't Stardew Valley, but this is something I am super proud of! I initially went into
                    development with an approach to staying in backend programming to become a game developer. This
                    project was one of the first times I had ever started writing code on my own. This utilizes C#, and
                    a ReadMe file can be found on the GitHub page for any questions you may have!</p>
